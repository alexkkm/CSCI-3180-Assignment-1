(a) For COBOL, in order to force you to program as in the old days, ONLY 2 keywords
are allowed in selection and loop statements: “IF” and “GOTO”. You are not allowed
to use modern control constructs, such as if-then-else or while loop. Using any other
keywords will receive marks deduction. But for C, you can use whatever you want.

(b) For COBOL and C, you cannot use arrays or other data structure to store the records
of “master.txt”. Whenever you need to search the records of “master.txt”, read the file
directly.

(c) For COBOL, you cannot use “merge” statement directly. Please write a merge function
to merge two files by yourself.
